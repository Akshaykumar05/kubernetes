* Labels are the mechanism you use to organise Kubernetes Objects.
* Alabel is a key pair without any predefined meaning that can be attached to the objects.
* Labels are similar to tags in AWS or git where you use a name to quick reference.
* So you are free to choose labels as you need it to refer an environment which is used for dev or testing or Production, refer a product group like Department A , department B.



* Multiple labes\ls can be added to a single object.
